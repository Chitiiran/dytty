# Dytty — Testing Strategy

> Comprehensive testing guide covering all test layers, tools, workflows, and lessons learned.

## Philosophy

**TDD is mandatory.** Every feature and bug fix follows: tests first -> implement -> iterate -> verify.

Every bug fix must include a test that reproduces the bug before the fix. Every feature must include tests for its acceptance criteria. E2E tests are required for cross-screen UI state changes.

## Layer 1: Unit Tests

**Libraries:** `bloc_test`, `fake_cloud_firestore`, `mockito`

**What to test:**
- Bloc state transitions (events -> states)
- Repository CRUD operations (using `FakeFirebaseFirestore`)
- Model serialization/deserialization (toMap/fromMap)
- Service interfaces (using fakes/mocks)

**Commands:**
```bash
flutter test                          # Run all unit tests
flutter test test/features/auth/      # Run specific directory
flutter test --coverage               # With coverage report
```

**Conventions:**
- Test files mirror `lib/` structure: `lib/features/auth/` -> `test/features/auth/`
- File naming: `<source>_test.dart`
- Use `blocTest<Bloc, State>()` for Bloc testing
- Use `FakeFirebaseFirestore()` — never mock Firestore

### Unit Test Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **`FakeFirebaseFirestore` does not enforce security rules or composite indexes** — Your tests will pass even if Firestore rules would block the operation in production, and queries that require composite indexes will succeed without them. Firebase emulators also skip index enforcement. The only way to catch missing indexes is to test against real Firestore. **Mitigation:** whenever you add a query with `.where() + .orderBy()` or multiple `.where()` clauses, update `firestore.indexes.json` and deploy with `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`.

2. **`blocTest` runs events synchronously by default** — If your Bloc uses `await` in event handlers, use `wait: Duration(...)` or the `build`/`act`/`expect` pattern carefully. Missing `wait` leads to flaky tests that pass locally but fail in CI.

3. **Sealed class events can't be mocked** — `JournalEvent` is a sealed class, so `registerFallbackValue(FakeJournalEvent())` won't compile. Don't stub `bloc.add()` — `MockBloc` from `bloc_test` handles it automatically.

4. **`FakeFirebaseFirestore` auto-ID collisions** — When testing multiple `add()` calls in the same test, the fake may assign predictable IDs. Don't assert on auto-generated document IDs.

5. **Timezone sensitivity** — Tests using `DateTime.now()` can fail around midnight or in different CI timezones. Use fixed dates like `DateTime(2026, 3, 15)` in test data.

---

## Layer 2: Widget Tests (Robot Pattern)

**Libraries:** `flutter_test`, `bloc_test`, `mocktail`

**What to test:**
- Individual widget rendering with given props
- Tap handlers fire correctly
- Loading/error/empty states display properly
- Accessibility labels present

**Location:** `test/widgets/` mirroring `lib/features/` structure.

**Robot Pattern:** One Robot class per screen encapsulates interaction logic. Tests read like user stories:

```dart
// test/robots/home_screen_robot.dart
class HomeScreenRobot {
  HomeScreenRobot(this.tester);
  final WidgetTester tester;

  void expectNudgeCardVisible() {
    expect(find.textContaining("haven't journaled"), findsOneWidget);
  }
  // ...
}

// test/widgets/home_screen_test.dart — reads like a spec
testWidgets('nudge card visible when no entries', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpApp(const HomeScreen());
  final robot = HomeScreenRobot(tester);
  robot.expectNudgeCardVisible();
});
```

**Key files:**
- `test/helpers/pump_app.dart` — shared test setup with mock Blocs
- `test/robots/` — Robot classes for each screen
- `test/widgets/` — Widget test files

**Commands:**
```bash
flutter test test/widgets/       # Run widget tests only
```

### Widget Test Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **`mocktail` vs `mockito` — don't mix them** — Widget tests use `mocktail` (required by `bloc_test`'s `MockBloc`/`MockCubit`). Unit tests use `mockito`. They have different stub syntax (`when(() => ...)` vs `when(mock.method()).then...`). Pick the right one per test file.

2. **Stream stubs are required for BlocBuilder** — Mocking `bloc.state` alone isn't enough. You must also stub `bloc.stream` or `BlocBuilder` will throw. Use `when(() => mockBloc.stream).thenAnswer((_) => const Stream.empty())`.

3. **`pumpAndSettle` can hang on animations** — If a widget uses `flutter_animate` or repeating animations, `pumpAndSettle` never completes. Use `pump(Duration(...))` instead for a fixed wait.

4. **GoogleFonts throws in tests** — `GoogleFonts.inter()` triggers HTTP font downloads that fail in the test environment. The Inter font is bundled in `assets/fonts/` and `test/flutter_test_config.dart` sets `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching = false`. The test-safe wrapper in `test/helpers/pump_app.dart` handles this.

5. **Theme must be provided** — Widgets that use `Theme.of(context)` will crash without a `MaterialApp` ancestor. Always use `pumpApp()` from `test/helpers/pump_app.dart`, not raw `pumpWidget()`.

6. **`find.text` vs `find.textContaining`** — `find.text('Progress')` matches exact strings only. For dynamic text like "Progress 3 of 5", use `find.textContaining('Progress')`.

---

## Layer 3: Golden Tests (Visual Regression)

**Tool:** Built-in `matchesGoldenFile` from `flutter_test`.

**What to capture:** Login screen (default, loading, error, dark), journal screen (empty, with entries, dark), dashboard states.

**Location:** `test/goldens/` with baseline PNGs in `test/goldens/fixtures/`.

**Commands:**
```bash
flutter test test/goldens/                       # Verify goldens match
flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens/      # Regenerate baseline PNGs
```

**Workflow:**
1. Write golden test with `matchesGoldenFile('fixtures/name.png')`
2. First run: `flutter test --update-goldens test/goldens/` to generate baselines
3. Commit the PNG files to git
4. Run `flutter test test/goldens/` locally — fails if pixels differ

**CI status:** Golden tests are tagged `@Tags(['golden'])` and excluded in CI via `--exclude-tags=golden`. Cross-platform font rendering differences between Windows (dev) and Ubuntu (CI) cause pixel mismatches. Tracked in [#48].

### Golden Test Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **Cross-platform rendering breaks goldens** — The same font renders differently on Windows (DirectWrite) vs Ubuntu (FreeType). Baselines generated on Windows will always fail on Ubuntu CI. Fix: use `alchemist` package for platform-independent rendering, or generate baselines on the CI platform.

2. **GoogleFonts must be bundled, not downloaded** — `GoogleFonts.inter()` triggers HTTP requests that fail in tests. Solution: bundle Inter TTF files in `assets/fonts/`, register in `pubspec.yaml`, and set `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching = false` in `test/flutter_test_config.dart`.

3. **`testWidgets` only accepts `bool` for `skip`** — Unlike the base `test` package which accepts `String`, `testWidgets` only takes `bool?`. Use `skip: true`, not `skip: 'reason string'`.

4. **Golden PNGs can be large** — Login screen goldens are ~740KB each. Commit them but be aware of repo size. Consider `.gitattributes` with Git LFS if golden count grows significantly.

5. **Animation frames affect goldens** — If you capture during an animation, each run may produce different frames. Always `pump(Duration(seconds: 1))` before capturing to let animations settle.

6. **`goldenWrapper` provides isolated Blocs** — The `test/goldens/golden_test_helper.dart` provides a `goldenWrapper()` function that creates fresh mock Blocs per test. Pass state overrides via parameters like `authState:`, `journalState:`, etc.

---

## Layer 4: Integration Tests (Patrol)

**Tool:** Patrol 3.13+

**Why Patrol over plain `integration_test`:** Dytty uses mic permission (voice notes), notification permission (reminders), and Google Sign-In (native OAuth). All trigger native OS dialogs that only Patrol can interact with.

**Packages:** `patrol: ^3.13.0`, `patrol_finders: ^2.4.0` in `dev_dependencies`.

**Structure:**
```
integration_test/
├── robots/                        # Robot classes (same vocabulary as widget test robots)
│   ├── home_screen_robot.dart
│   ├── journal_screen_robot.dart
│   └── auth_robot.dart
├── flows/
│   ├── auth_flow_test.dart        # Login -> verify home -> logout
│   ├── journal_crud_test.dart     # Add -> verify -> edit -> delete
│   └── dashboard_state_test.dart  # Add entries -> verify progress updates
└── app_test_setup.dart            # Common setup: pump app with emulator config
```

**Commands:**
```bash
bash scripts/patrol-test.sh                    # Run all integration tests
bash scripts/patrol-test.sh --flow auth        # Run specific flow
bash scripts/patrol-test.sh --skip-build       # Skip APK build
```

**When to run:** Release candidates only (too slow for every PR).

**Status:** Scaffold created with commented-out implementations. Patrol packages not yet added to `pubspec.yaml` (waiting for first native-dialog feature to be tested).

### Integration Test Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **Patrol requires native build** — Unlike widget tests, Patrol tests compile to a real APK and run on a device/emulator. Build time is ~60s before any test runs.

2. **Permission dialogs are OS-version-specific** — The "Allow microphone" dialog text changes between Android API levels. Use Patrol's `$.native.grantPermissionWhenInUse()` instead of tapping by text.

3. **Firebase emulator setup must happen in-app** — Patrol launches the real app, so emulator config must be in `main.dart` (controlled by `--dart-define=USE_EMULATORS=true`), not in test setup.

4. **Shared Robot vocabulary** — Integration test Robots should use the same method names as widget test Robots (`expectNudgeCardVisible()`, `tapMicFab()`) so the mental model is consistent across layers.

## Layer 5: E2E Tests — Android (Maestro)

**Tool:** Maestro 2.3.0+

**How it works:**
1. Build debug APK with emulator flag
2. Install APK on Android emulator via ADB
3. Maestro runs YAML flows — interacts with the app via accessibility/view hierarchy
4. `takeScreenshot` captures visual state at key points for developer review
5. CI uploads screenshots as artifacts for every PR

### Prerequisites

- **Maestro CLI**: `curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash`
- **JDK 17+** (JDK 21 available at `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.10.7-hotspot`)
- **ADB**: Android SDK platform-tools (at `$LOCALAPPDATA/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/`)
- **Android emulator** running and visible via `adb devices`
- **Firebase emulators** running (Auth :9099, Firestore :8080)

### Commands

```bash
# Run all flows
bash scripts/maestro-test.sh

# Run specific feature flows
bash scripts/maestro-test.sh --flow auth
bash scripts/maestro-test.sh --flow journal

# Run by tag
bash scripts/maestro-test.sh --tags smoke

# Skip APK build (reuse existing)
bash scripts/maestro-test.sh --skip-build

# Interactive flow builder (great for debugging selectors)
maestro studio
```

### Flow Structure

```
.maestro/
├── config.yaml
├── helpers/
│   └── login.yaml                # Reusable: emulator login (clearState + sign in)
├── auth/
│   ├── login-flow.yaml           # Emulator login -> verify home screen
│   └── logout-flow.yaml          # Login -> settings -> sign out -> verify login screen
├── journal/
│   ├── add-entry-flow.yaml       # Add entry to Positive Things category
│   ├── dashboard-flow.yaml       # Verify calendar, progress, nudge card, FAB
│   └── navigate-days-flow.yaml   # Navigate between days via chevrons

```

### Tags

| Tag | Purpose | When to run |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `smoke` | Core happy paths — login, dashboard, add entry, nudge + progress state | Every PR (CI) |
| `state` | State management regression tests (cross-screen updates) | Every PR (CI) |
| `release` | Full regression suite | Release candidates only |
| `auth` | Authentication flows only | Auth changes |
| `journal` | Journal CRUD + navigation | Journal changes |
| `dashboard` | Dashboard element verification | Dashboard/state changes |

### Writing Maestro Flows

**Flow file anatomy:**
```yaml
appId: com.dytty.dytty          # App package ID
name: "Human-readable name"
tags:
  - smoke
  - feature-area
---
# Commands (sequential)
- launchApp:
    clearState: true

- takeScreenshot: "feature/01-step-name"

- assertVisible: "Button Text"

- tapOn: "Element text or regex"

- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 5000

- inputText: "typed content"
```

**Key Maestro commands:**
| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `launchApp` | Start app (with `clearState: true` for clean slate) |
| `tapOn` | Tap by text, id, or regex pattern |
| `assertVisible` | Verify element is on screen |
| `inputText` | Type into focused field |
| `takeScreenshot` | Capture PNG for visual verification |
| `waitForAnimationToEnd` | Wait for Flutter transitions to settle |
| `scroll` / `scrollUntilVisible` | Scroll to find elements |
| `back` | Android back button |
| `pressKey` | Simulate hardware key (Enter, etc.) |
| `runFlow` | Compose flows (e.g., reuse login) |

**Element identification (what Maestro sees):**
- `tooltip` on `IconButton` -> text content
- `Semantics(label:)` -> accessibility label
- Visible text on widgets
- Resource IDs (less common in Flutter)

**Key semantic labels in Dytty:**

| Label | Widget |
|-------|--------|
| `"Sign in anonymously (emulator)"` | Emulator login button |
| `"Sign in with Google"` | Google login button |
| `"\\?"` | Settings icon button (shows as `?` in accessibility tree) |
| `"Record voice note"` | Mic FAB tooltip |
| `"Calendar"` | Calendar widget |
| `"Progress X of Y"` | Progress card |
| `"Today button"` | Write journal button |
| `"Previous day"` / `"Next day"` | Journal day navigation |
| `"Add [Category] entry"` | Category add buttons |
| `"Journal entry: [text]"` | Entry tiles |
| `"Edit entry"` / `"Delete entry"` | Entry action buttons |

### Maestro Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **`assertVisible` does NOT do substring matching** — it matches against the full `accessibilityText` of a node. Use regex `".*partial text.*"` for partial matching.

2. **Curly/smart apostrophes** — Source code may use `\u2019` (right single quote) in strings like "haven't". Maestro can't match literal `'`. Use regex: `"You haven.*journaled today.*"`.

3. **Flutter cold start timing** — `waitForAnimationToEnd` completes instantly if no animation is detected (white screen = no pixel changes). Chain triple `waitForAnimationToEnd` after login to catch route transition -> loading spinner -> data load animations.

4. **Parallel flow interference** — Flows sharing an emulator with `clearState: true` can interfere with each other. The runner script (`scripts/maestro-test.sh`) runs each flow individually and sequentially to avoid this.

5. **`scrollUntilVisible` + `centerElement: true`** — When elements are below the fold (like the 5th category card), `centerElement: true` ensures the element is scrolled to center, not just barely visible at the edge. Without it, tap targets may be partially off-screen.

6. **`retryTapIfNoChange: true`** — Use on buttons that may not register the first tap (e.g., after scroll, or when the view is still settling).

7. **`inputText` for autofocused fields** — If a TextField has `autofocus: true`, you can use `inputText` directly without tapping the field first.

8. **Stylus handwriting dialog** — Android emulators may show "Try out your stylus" dialog when tapping text fields. Disable with: `adb shell settings put secure stylus_handwriting_enabled 0`.

9. **Firebase emulator host on Android** — Use `10.0.2.2` (not `localhost`) to reach the host machine from an Android emulator.

10. **Settings button accessibility** — The settings `IconButton` with a `?` icon renders as `"?"` in the accessibility tree, not the tooltip text. Tap with: `tapOn: "\\?"`.

---

## E2E Tests — Web (Playwright)

**Tool:** Playwright v1.50.0

**How it works:**
1. Build web app with emulator flag: `flutter build web --dart-define=USE_EMULATORS=true`
2. Serve the build: `npx serve build/web -l 5555`
3. Playwright drives headless Chromium against the served app
4. Firebase emulators provide backend (Auth :9099, Firestore :8080)

**Commands:**
```bash
npm install                           # Install Playwright
npx playwright test                   # Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test --headed          # Run with visible browser
npx playwright test --debug           # Debug mode (step through)
```

**Structure:**
```
e2e/
├── auth.spec.ts          # Login/sign-out flows
├── journal.spec.ts       # CRUD operations
├── home-state.spec.ts    # Dashboard state management
├── debug.spec.ts         # Debug-specific tests
└── helpers.ts            # Firebase emulator setup, Flutter DOM helpers
```

**Key helpers:**
- `clearEmulatorAuth()` / `clearEmulatorFirestore()` — reset emulator state
- `waitForFlutterReady()` — wait for `flutter-view` + `flt-semantics` elements
- `signInAnonymously()` — click emulator debug button, wait for navigation
- `clickByLabel()` / `expectTextVisible()` — accessibility tree queries

**Config:** `playwright.config.ts` — timeout 120s per test, 180s server startup, HTML reporter with screenshots on failure.

### Playwright Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **Flutter web semantics are in shadow DOM** — Flutter renders into a shadow root inside `flutter-view`. Use `page.locator('flt-semantics')` to query the accessibility tree, not regular DOM selectors.

2. **`tooltip` renders as text content** — `IconButton(tooltip: 'Settings')` becomes a clickable element with text "Settings" in the Flutter web accessibility tree. Use `getByRole('button', { name: 'Settings' })`.

3. **`Semantics(label:)` vs visible text** — `Semantics` labels are only visible to the accessibility tree. Visible text on widgets is also exposed. Prefer `Semantics` for test stability (decoupled from UI copy changes).

4. **Firebase emulators must be running** — Playwright tests require `firebase emulators:start` running in a separate terminal. The `webServer` config in `playwright.config.ts` handles serving the built app but not emulators.

5. **Cold start is slow** — Flutter web takes 10-20s to fully initialize (compile shaders, load fonts, hydrate). Use `waitForFlutterReady()` which polls for `flt-semantics` elements before interacting.

6. **Cleartext HTTP for emulators** — Web builds connecting to localhost emulators work fine (no CORS issues), but Android builds need `network_security_config.xml` for cleartext traffic to `10.0.2.2`.

## Screenshot-Driven AI Development Workflow

This is the primary workflow for AI-assisted development with Maestro:

1. **Write unit tests** (`flutter test`) — fast TDD cycle for logic
2. **Implement** — minimum code to pass unit tests
3. **Run Maestro flows** — `bash scripts/maestro-test.sh`
4. **Review screenshots** — developer inspects `.maestro/screenshots/<timestamp>/` for visual correctness
5. **Iterate** — AI agent adjusts code based on screenshot feedback
6. **CI verification** — PR triggers Maestro job, screenshots uploaded as artifacts

**In CI (GitHub Actions):**
- The `maestro` job runs `smoke`-tagged flows on every PR and main push
- Screenshots are uploaded as artifacts (14-day retention)
- Download from: Actions tab -> workflow run -> Artifacts -> `maestro-screenshots`
- JUnit XML results included for pass/fail reporting

### Phase-by-Phase Detail

#### Phase 1: Local Development (your machine)

| Step | What | Command | Time |
|------|------|---------|------|
| 1 | Create branch from `main` | `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b fix/49-nudge-stuck` | instant |
| 2 | Write failing test (TDD) | Write test in `test/`, run `flutter test` — must FAIL | ~2s |
| 3 | Implement the fix | Edit source code | varies |
| 4 | Run unit + widget tests | `flutter test` | ~5s |
| 5 | Run golden tests | `flutter test test/goldens/` | ~5s |
| 6 | All pass? | If no -> iterate (step 3). If yes -> continue | — |
| 7 | Commit and push | `git commit`, `git push -u origin fix/49-nudge-stuck` | instant |

**What does NOT run locally:** Maestro E2E, Patrol integration tests, coverage enforcement. You *can* run these locally (`bash scripts/maestro-test.sh`) but they're slow (~90s/flow) so they're not part of the fast TDD loop.

#### Phase 2: CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions — automatic on push)

Two jobs run in parallel:

**Job 1: Analyze, Test & Build** (~2 min)

| Check | What | Blocks merge? |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Analyze | `flutter analyze --no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos lib test` | Yes (errors only) |
| Test | `flutter test --coverage --exclude-tags=golden` | Yes |
| Coverage | Must meet minimum gate (ratchets up 10%/week toward 100%) | Yes |
| Build | Web + debug APK | Yes |

**Job 2: Maestro Android E2E** (~5 min)

| Check | What | Blocks merge? |
|-------|------|---------------|
| E2E | Boot emulator, install APK, run `smoke` + `state` tagged flows | Yes |

If CI fails, fix locally, push again. CI re-runs automatically.

#### Phase 3: Pull Request (GitHub — manual)

| Step | What | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| Open PR | PR to `main` with description | You |
| Review | Code review | You / reviewer |
| Merge | When approved + "Analyze, Test & Build" green | You |

Branch protection on `main` requires "Analyze, Test & Build" to pass.

#### Phase 4: Production Deploy (GitHub Actions — automatic on main merge)

| Step | What | Time |
|------|------|------|
| Build | Build web app | ~1 min |
| Deploy | Firebase Hosting (live) | ~30s |
| Tag | Git tag `vX.Y.Z` from pubspec version | instant |

**Web app is now live.** Android users get the fix in the next release.

### When Does `distribute.sh` Run?

`distribute.sh` is for **ad-hoc Android testing** — it runs **locally on your machine**, not in CI.

| Scenario | How | Where |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Quick dogfooding** | `bash scripts/distribute.sh "Fix nudge card bug"` | **Local** — builds debug APK, uploads to Firebase App Distribution |
| **Release candidate** | Push `release/*` branch -> `release-candidate.yml` -> `distribute` job | **GitHub Actions** — builds release APK, uploads automatically |
| **Hotfix** | `bash scripts/distribute.sh "Hotfix: ..."` | **Local** |

**distribute.sh does:**
1. Reads `.env` for API keys
2. Auto-increments version in `pubspec.yaml`
3. Builds debug APK (`flutter build apk --debug`)
4. Uploads to Firebase App Distribution via `firebase appdistribution:distribute`
5. Sends email to `TESTER_EMAIL` with your release notes

## CI/CD Pipeline (3 Workflow Files)

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PRs to main

| Job | What | Blocks merge? |
|-----|------|---------------|
| `analyze-test` | dart format + flutter analyze + test + coverage + build web + build APK | Yes |
| `maestro` | Maestro E2E with `smoke,state` tags | Yes |

### `.github/workflows/release-candidate.yml` — Release branches

| Job | What | Blocks release? |
|-----|------|-----------------|
| `analyze-test` | flutter analyze + test + coverage | Yes |
| `build` | Web + release APK builds | Yes |
| `maestro` | Full Maestro suite (`smoke,state,release` tags) | Yes |
| `distribute` | Upload APK to Firebase App Distribution | Automated |

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — Push to main

| Job | What |
|-----|------|
| `build` | Build web |
| `deploy` | Firebase Hosting deploy |
| `tag` | Create git tag `vX.Y.Z` |

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Set? |
|--------|---------|------|
| `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` | Web build dart-define | Yes |
| `FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY` | Android build dart-define | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` | google-services.json for APK builds | Yes |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DYTTY_4B83D` | Firebase Hosting deploy + App Distribution | Yes |
| `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID` | App Distribution upload | Needed |

### Quality Gates

| Gate | When | What runs |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Gate 1: Dev loop** | Every save | `dart format` + `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` (~10s) |
| **Gate 2: PR** | Every PR push | Format + analyze + test + coverage + build + Maestro smoke |
| **Gate 3: Release candidate** | Release branch push | All Gate 2 + Maestro full suite + App Distribution |
| **Gate 4: Dogfooding** | 2-3 day window | Internal testers via Firebase App Distribution |
| **Gate 5: Production** | Merge to main | Auto deploy web + tag release |

### What Runs Where — Summary

| Layer | Local | CI (PR) | Release Candidate | Production |

## Adding Tests — Checklist

### New feature
- [ ] Unit tests for Bloc events/states
- [ ] Unit tests for repository methods (if new)
- [ ] Unit tests for model serialization (if new model)
- [ ] Firestore composite indexes updated in `firestore.indexes.json` (if new compound queries added) and deployed with `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
- [ ] Widget tests with Robot pattern for new screens/widgets
- [ ] Golden tests for key visual states
- [ ] Playwright E2E if the feature involves cross-screen state changes (web)
- [ ] Maestro flow if the feature has an Android-specific interaction
- [ ] `takeScreenshot` at key visual states in Maestro flows
- [ ] Patrol integration test if the feature involves native OS dialogs

### Bug fix
- [ ] Unit test that reproduces the bug (must fail before fix)
- [ ] Fix the bug
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Update golden baselines if visual change (`flutter test --update-goldens`)
- [ ] Add Maestro screenshot if the bug was visual

### Refactor
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Golden tests still match (or update baselines)
- [ ] No new tests needed unless behavior changes
